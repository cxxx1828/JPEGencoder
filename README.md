This project implements a software-based JPEG encoder that converts raw image data into compressed JPEG format. The encoder follows the standard JPEG compression pipeline, which consists of several key stages. First, the input image in RGB color space is converted to YCbCr color space, separating luminance information from chrominance. The chrominance channels are then downsampled using 4:2:0 subsampling to reduce data size while preserving perceived image quality, since human vision is less sensitive to color detail than brightness. Next, the image is divided into 8×8 pixel blocks, and each block undergoes a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) which converts spatial domain data into frequency domain coefficients. The DCT concentrates most of the image energy into low-frequency coefficients, making compression more effective. Following the DCT, quantization is applied using standard JPEG quantization tables, where high-frequency coefficients are divided by larger values and rounded, effectively discarding less important visual information. The quantized coefficients are then organized in a zigzag pattern to group low-frequency and high-frequency components together. Finally, entropy coding is applied using Huffman encoding, which assigns shorter bit codes to more frequently occurring values. The encoder outputs a valid JPEG file with proper headers, markers, and metadata including image dimensions, color space information, and quantization tables. In practice, the pipeline works as follows: raw pixel data enters the encoder, goes through color conversion and subsampling, is split into blocks for DCT transformation, undergoes quantization based on desired quality level, gets reordered and entropy-coded, and finally outputs as a compressed JPEG bitstream with significantly reduced file size compared to the original raw data. With this architecture, the JPEG encoder achieves efficient lossy compression suitable for photographs and natural images, balancing compression ratio against visual quality. The modular design allows easy adjustment of quality parameters and makes the system suitable for integration into image processing applications, embedded systems, or as an educational tool for understanding image compression techniques.
